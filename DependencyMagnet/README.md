# SwiftDependencyMagnet

### The Problem

Have you ever thought to youself:

[Yes](https://forums.swift.org/t/swiftpm-how-to-prevent-resolve-packages-from-stymying-developer-productivity-local-packages/63363), 
it [can](https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/sdgw5i/resolving_package_graph_takes_ages/) 
be [annoying](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77180553/xcode-15-checking-out-package-is-taking-forever). 
On a project with a moderate amount of SPM
dependencies, Xcode seems to randomly re-resolve the package graph
for 15-30 seconds (or more) any time a mote of dust hits your project the wrong way.

Assuming that most of your dependencies are hosted on remote git repos,
a fair bit of this time is spent dealing with the latency of checking the
state of those remote repos, and resolving the version graph.

### The Solution

SwiftDependencyMagnet lets you remove the 'remote' aspect of your SPM
dependencies from the perspective of your build tools, and SPM does not
require version resolution for local packages.

You declare the top-level dependencies that your project uses. The magnet uses SPM
to resolve the graph and put all of your dependencies (and their sub-dependencies) in
a local directory. All of their Package.swift contents are relinked so that they 
refer to the local versions as well.   

You now have full control over when package/version resolution occurs.

### Installation

#### Using Package.swift

Add SwiftDependencyMagnet to your Package.swift file:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/jmfieldman/SwiftDependencyMagnet.git", from: "<version>")
```

Swift PM will automatically detect the executable target, so you can now run the executable through your own package:

```bash
$ swift run dependency_magnet <params>
```

#### Standalone (Mint)

If you want a more streamlined execution experience, try installing SwiftDependencyMagnet 
using the very nice [Mint Package Manager](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint).

Mint builds each Swift executable in its own environment, tracks versions, and supports 
localized version-pegging through a Mintfile. This avoids continuous, unnecessary 
rebuild-checks when your own project's Package.swift changes.

```bash
# Install mint on your system, e.g.
$ brew install mint

# Install SwiftDependencyMagnet (recommended: bypass this using the Mintfile)
$ mint install jmfieldman/SwiftDependencyMagnet

# Run SwiftDependencyMagnet using Mint. This is the recommended method if you plan
# on using a Mintfile for version-pegging
$ mint run dependency_magnet <..>

# Or run it directly if you have the Mint bin directory in your path
$ dependency_magnet <..>
```

### Using SwiftDependencyMagnet

Create the top-level folder `Dependencies` and put your `dependencies.yml` configuration inside it:

```
Dependencies
    +--- dependencies.yml # contains a list of your dependencies
```

Your `dependencies.yml` file will look something like:

```yml
dependencies:
  - url: https://github.com/apple/swift-argument-parser
    exact: 1.3.1
  - url: https://github.com/jpsim/Yams.git
    from: 5.0.6    
    
# Each dependency must have a URL and one qualifier.
# Valid qualifiers are: exact, from, range, closedRange, branch, revision
```

Run the pull command:

```shell
$ swift run dependency_magnet pull
<SwiftPM resolution>
ðŸ§² Importing [swift-argument-parser @ 1.3.1]
ðŸ§² Importing [Yams @ 5.1.0]
```

At which point you will now have the following new files in your directory:

```bash
.dependency_magnet        # This is the shadow workspace; safe to .gitignore
    |
    +--- Package.resolved # The Package.resolved file in the shadow workspace
    |                     # This file is pulled from the source-controlled version
    |                     # before every sync.
    |
    +--- Package.swift    # The Package.swift file in the shadow workspace, which
    |                     # is auto-generated based on your dependencies.
    |
    +--- .build           # Where SwiftPM has pulled remote dependencies
    
Dependencies
    +--- dependencies.yml # Your dependencies configuration.
    |
    +--- Package.resolved # A source-controllable location for Package.resolved
    |                     # Make sure this is checked in to ensure that all
    |                     # users get the same versions of your dependencies.
    |
    +--- Packages         # This is where your locally-configured dependencies
         |                # live, and where you will point your Package.swift to.
         |                # Add this to your .gitignore to avoid recommitting all
         |                # of your dependencies to your main repo.
         |
         +--- swift-argument-parser
         +--- Yams
         +--- ...
```

#### Updating .gitignore

It is recommended that you add the following to `.gitignore`:

```
.dependency_magnet
Dependencies/Packages/
```

#### Using Package.swift

If are using your own `Package.swift` file, you can now reference your locally-based dependencies like so:

```swift
let package = Package(
  ...
  products: [...],
  dependencies: [
    .package(path: "Dependencies/Package/swift-argument-parser"),
    .package(path: "Dependencies/Package/Yams"),
  ],
  targets: [...]
)

```

#### Using Xcode

If you are using an Xcode-based project, you can select `File > Add Package Dependencies...` and then
select the `Add Local` button to choose your local top-level dependencies.

#### Using Xcodegen

if you are using the wonderful [Xcodegen](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen) utility, you can 
use the [packages](https://github.com/yonaskolb/XcodeGen/blob/master/Docs/ProjectSpec.md#swift-package) directive 
to point to your new local paths:

```yml
packages:
  Yams:
    path: Dependencies/Package/Yams
  MyCoolLibrary:
    path: Dependencies/Package/MyCoolLibrary
```
